Description: A function that facilitates fitting three types of models 
    for contrast-based Bayesian Network Meta Analysis.  The first model is that which
    is described in Lu and Ades (2006) <doi:10.1198/016214505000001302>.  The other two 
    models are based on a Bayesian nonparametric methods that permit ties when comparing 
    treatment or for a treatment effect to be exactly equal to zero. In addition to the 
    model fits, the package provides a summary of the interplay  between treatment 
    effects based on the procedure described in Barrientos, Page, and Lin (2023)
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2207.06561>.
